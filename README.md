# Jarvis
## The Future of Personal Assistants 

Jarvis is a custom Voice Command program that interacts with the user through audio and speech.

The framework is based upon Python, getting support from local TTS programs (use either festival or espeak)

It uses libraries from the speechrecognition (which is based off of Google's voice to text backend) to recognize and process audio. As such, this program requires an active internet connection to operate

Currently, functions that are supported include searching the web, and retrieving gmail preferences(official Google libraries)

To enable searching the web, please download surfraw
To enable recieving email, please download the google gmail library, and request an application key from google
